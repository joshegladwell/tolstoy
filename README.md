# An NLP Project on the Writings of Leo Tolstoy

As of June 2022, the code of this project deals with scraping tolstoy.ru to build a dataset/corpus of Tolstoy's writings in the original Russian. Because of the large size of the data, it is not included in this repository. You may run the scraper to get the data by executing ```python3 data/bin/main.py``` from this repository's root directory in your terminal.
